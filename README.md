# WarCardGame
Group project for SYST17796 Fundamentals of Software Development and Design.

Technology used: Java, NetBeans, Visual Paradigm

## Project Goal and Vision
Our project goal is to create an interactive card game program using Java. The program must function properly and smoothly. On the coding side, each class should be loosely coupled so that classes operate independently, and it will help us maintain the whole project more efficiently. Also, we will achieve high cohesion by describing a class as a single entity and making them logically connected to each other. Our final vision is to accomplish writing clean code through the entire project using debugging tools and code refactoring, applying OO concepts, and cooperation with team members on GitHub.

## Team Members
This game was built by Tamara Dang, Kayla Jinyoung Jeon, Jenny Juyoung Jung, and Winston Martinez.
